`cloudflare-graphql-typescript` is a template for creating a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) server with serverless [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), written in TypeScript. It uses the [apollo-server-cloudflare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-cloudflare) library to create the server and the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) as a REST API source.
